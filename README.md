# VCF Digital Name Card

This is a frontend-only React application for creating and sharing a digital business card.
Users can enter their details, preview the card, download a `.vcf` file and get a QR code that encodes the vCard text for quick import on mobile devices.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The app can be deployed on services such as Vercel since it contains no backend code.
